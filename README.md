# CreateES
ES Module version of CreateJS

CreateJS is no longer maintained, however it's still widely used to render AdobeAn SVG animations on the web. The original CreateJS NPM package was not poperly exported for being used as a CommonJS or ES module, so to avoid implementing workarounds in different module bundlers to make it work, I decided to create this litte wrapper for it.
